[Required]
resistance_file = C:/Users/Nathan/Desktop/Omnitrial/nlincost2.asc
[radius is how much of the surrounding area will be considered to assign a pixel a random-walk value. for elephants, we are using ~30km with 90x90. Radius units are pixels]
radius = 334
[block size is used if we want to spatially separate random walk pixels-for this project we want all pixels considered, so use block size 1]
block_size = 5
project_name = C:/Users/Nathan/Desktop/Omnitrial/elephant_trial

[General options]
[source from resistance means that we are not providing locations for sources, but rather using every pixel in the resistance map to estimate connectivity]
source_from_resistance = true

[SDM is already converted into a cost matrix. If using non-converted SDM output, we can assign the values as conductances rather than resitsances]
resistance_is_conductance=false
[r_cutoff will not estimate cells with a certain value. We'll keep this Inf so that all pixels are estimated]
r_cutoff = Inf
[calc normalized current will estimate current of pixels after removing the flow potential. This will disentangle IBD effects from the effects of the SDM]
calc_normalized_current = true
[calc flow potential will show current across the landscape with uniform resistance (without resistance)]
calc_flow_potential = true

[Output options]
[This will write the raw current map. The different maps are related as raw_current_map-flow_potential=normalized_current]
write_raw_currmap = true
